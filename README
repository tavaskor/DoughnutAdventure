This code is based off of a submission for an X11 project made in a
university course.  The project was simply to make a game where
collissions with doughnuts would increase weight and other foods would
decrease it; the game would end once a low-end weight threshold was passed.


Gameplay documentation:

The character will move left or right as long as the appropriate key is
depressed.  Jump does not operate the same; the character reaches a maximum
height and remains there until either the jump key is released or the
maximum jump length (dependent on weight) is reached.  Jump height is also
a function of weight.

Pressing the P key pauses the game; the character does not move and the
food on the conveyor belt does not advance.  Changes in key presses are still
registered, however, and go into effect once the game is unpaused.

1 switches the game into easy mode, and 2 into hard mode.  In hard mode,
the conveyor belt moves faster, food appears on the belt more often, and
there is a smaller probability of any given food instance being a doughnut
as well as a higher probability of any given food being healthier (ie,
causing a larger weight loss).

A doughnut causes a weight gain of 5, while cheese, carrots, and celery
cause weight losses of 3, 7, and 10 respectively.  The player starts at
150 pounds, and the game is over if the player's weight falls to
100 pounds or below.

The character will visibly grow and shrink in terms of width as the weight
increases or decreases.  As weight increases, both the jump height and jump
length (the amount of time the player can remain suspended in the air on one
jump) decrease.  This is beneficial to characters who are low on weight; they
can fit between two foods without colliding with either easier, and can stay in
the air longer to get over a chain of healthy foods.
